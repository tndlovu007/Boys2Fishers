<h1>Mentoring programs</h1>

<h2>Boys Becoming Men</h2>
	<p>
		Boys to Men to Fishers of Men seeks to reach its goals by exposing 
	 young men to swimming, fishing, boating, and the great outdoors.
	 Swimming, fishing and boating all require physical and mental discipline.
	 It is our hope that through exposure to these sports youth will be catapulted
	 down the right path.Through the course of the program mentors and other volunteers
	 will be able to meet and build relationships with the young men.  Our mentors have been
	 vetted through Alabamaâ€™s CAN program and criminal background checks. They have a passion
	 for fishing and boating, and a desire to teach and mentor kids in this sport. We use fishing
	 and boating as the hook (excuse the pun) to gain the attention of the young men,
	 and ultimatelypoint them to Christ. 
	 </p>

<h2>Men Becoming Fishers of Men</h2>
	<p>
	The Christian principles and values  learned in our program will not only ground these young men
	 in love, but it will all teach them to care for the fellow man. 
	</p>

<h2>Fisher Men Becoming Disciplers </h2>
	<p>
	With every good thing you do, you hope is to impact the future.  Boys to Men to Fishers of Men hopes
	 that the Christian values it teaches will impact the future in such a way that the youth served will
	 want to go out and share the good news with others.  
	</p>

<h2>Become A Mentor </h2>
	<p>
